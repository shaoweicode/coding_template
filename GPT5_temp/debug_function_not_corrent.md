The script runs without crashing, but the behavior is incorrect.

I will provide:
- The inputs I used
- The actual output
- The output I expected
- The relevant parts of the code

Please:
1. Compare the expected behavior with the actual behavior.
2. Identify which part of the logic is likely wrong.
3. Propose a minimal fix:
   - Show only the changed code segments.
4. Suggest 2–3 simple test cases I can run to confirm the fix.

Inputs used:
[PASTE]

Actual output:
[PASTE]

Expected output:
[DESCRIBE OR PASTE]

Relevant code:
[PASTE ONLY THE FUNCTIONS OR SECTIONS LIKELY INVOLVED]
