Using the architecture and plan we have in `docs/plan.md`, I want to implement only the first small milestone as a minimal end-to-end slice.

Here is the relevant plan section:
[PASTE THE PART OF plan.md ABOUT MILESTONE 1]

Please:
1. Generate the initial project structure (files and folders) and show me:
   - The tree of files/folders
   - Which file I should run as the entry point
2. For this milestone, implement only the minimal code needed so that:
   - I can run the entry-point script.
   - It performs a very basic end-to-end flow, even if it uses placeholders or stub implementations.
3. Include comments in the code explaining the role of each main function/class.
4. Keep the code as simple and explicit as possible because I am not a professional developer.
5. Do NOT implement future milestones yet; just stubs with TODO comments.

If code becomes long, focus on the main files I need to create and run first, then we can iterate.
