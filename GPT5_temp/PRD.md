Now that we’ve discussed the idea and you’ve asked your questions, Here is the latest information you have from me:
FILE: docs/PRE_PRD_<project_name>.md

NOW:
1. Produce a structured, concise requirements document for this project with these sections:
   - Overview (2–4 sentences)
   - User roles and user stories
   - Detailed functional requirements (as numbered items)
   - Non-functional requirements and constraints
   - Example inputs and outputs (with realistic examples)
   - Out-of-scope items (things we explicitly will NOT implement for now)
2. Make sure all requirements are realistic for a small project and for a non-professional developer.
3. Highlight any open questions that still need decisions.

Use clear headings and bullet points, save result to file docs/PRD_<project_name>.md
