I tried to run the code you helped me write, and I got an error.

I will provide:
- The command I ran
- The environment
- The full error message / stack trace
- What I expected vs what actually happened
- Any recent code changes I made manually

Please:
1. Identify the most likely root cause.
2. Explain the cause in simple language so I can understand.
3. Propose a minimal fix:
   - Show only the code sections that need changing.
   - Clearly mark old vs new code, or provide a short patch/diff-style suggestion.
4. Warn me if you suspect other parts of the code might also be affected and what to test after the fix.

Environment:
[OS, Python version, etc.]

Command:
[PASTE EXACT COMMAND]

Error / output:
[PASTE FULL ERROR TRACE OR RELEVANT OUTPUT]

Expected vs actual behavior:
[YOUR DESCRIPTION]

Recent changes:
[WHAT YOU CHANGED, IF ANY]
