I want a simple testing strategy for this project.

I will provide:
- The current requirements (or summary)
- A brief description of how the user runs the script/app
- Any critical behaviors I’m worried about

Please:
1. From the requirements, derive a list of manual test cases:
   - For each test: Input, steps to perform, and expected output/behavior.
   - Cover normal cases, edge cases, and error cases.
2. Optionally, propose simple automated tests:
   - Assume [e.g., Python + pytest] if appropriate.
   - Show example test functions for core features.
3. Suggest a minimal routine (e.g., “run these 5 tests after each major change”) that I can realistically follow.

Requirements / summary:
