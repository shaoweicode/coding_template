Using the requirements below, I want you to propose a simple, robust architecture and an incremental implementation plan suitable for a non-professional developer.

Here are the requirements:
FILE: docs/PRE_PRD_<project_name>.md

Constraints and preferences:
- Programming language: [your choice, e.g., Python 3.x]
- Target environment: [e.g., Windows 11, run as CLI script]
- Allowed third-party libraries: [list or “keep as few as possible”]

Please:
1. Propose a high-level architecture:
   - Main components/modules and their responsibilities
   - Data flow between components
   - Any important design decisions and trade-offs
2. Propose an initial project structure (files and folders) with a brief description for each file.
3. Create an incremental implementation plan broken into small milestones:
   - Milestone 1: [e.g., minimal end-to-end flow]
   - Milestone 2: [next feature] 
   ...etc.
4. For each milestone, list:
   - What exactly will be implemented
   - How we can test it manually (simple test plan)
   - Any risks or tricky parts

Format it clearly and save the output to file docs/plan_<project_name>.md.
