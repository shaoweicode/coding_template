I need to remove some obsolete features and add new ones.

I will provide:
- A list of features/behaviors that should be removed
- A list of new features/behaviors to add
- Relevant files or code sections
- Any updated requirements/plan information

Please:
1. Analyze the impact of removing the obsolete features:
   - Which functions/files are affected?
   - What can be safely deleted vs what should be refactored?
2. Propose changes to integrate the new features:
   - Where in the existing architecture they should go.
   - How they interact with existing components.
3. Provide updated code, focusing on:
   - Removing or deprecating obsolete code paths.
   - Implementing new features in a clean, modular way.
4. Suggest an updated short summary for `requirements.md` and `plan.md` to reflect these changes.
